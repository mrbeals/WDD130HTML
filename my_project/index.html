            <p class="herotxt"> Joceline began art in elementary exploring with anything she could get her hands on. Then moving to painting when she was first gifted paints. 
                She would scribble alot. She would create for her enjoyment and fun but as she got older art began meaning so much more to her. It was a way for her
                to express herself and through the moods and creations she would capture through practice and a steady hand. She persued art in highschool,
                winning awards in the school contest. She then moved to pursue it as a career, wanting to bring joy and meaning into the lives of those who saw it.
                As well as a way to worship God. She now pursues Art as a College student at BYU-Idaho, studying to receive her illustration degree.</p>
            <p class="herotxt">In life there is endless things to explore, and the same is true with art, Joceline continues her journey to express herself as she 
                explores new mediums to express the beauty that is inside her. She issues this challenge to all who find themselves in this corner: Explore life to the
                fullest and continue to find new ways to show love and be happy. There is not one way through life, and as you continue to explore this world, you will find 
                what speaks to you, and how you yourself have the ability to connect with others.
