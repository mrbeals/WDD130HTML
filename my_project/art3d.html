                <h1>Joceline's 3D Art Journey</h1>
                <p>After I finished high school I wanted to continue to grow my art skills. I researched different mediums saw a few videos on different 
                    artists. 3D art caught my attention. After working on 2D art work for so long it was such a new refreshing change. I always loved creating 
                    art and bringing it to life but 3D was exciting. It takes bringing art to life in an entire new level. I love getting my hands dirty and 
                    making 3D art. This is most rewarding part of creating in this form. It reminds me of when I was younger and would scrap many pieces of paper 
                    along with random materials to make art in kindergarten. I feel like that little girl again, she still lives within myself. 
                    Though 3D is where I fully express that childlike wonder and playfulness. Itâ€™s like creating magic and watching it come to life for me.

                <p><i>Peaceful House</i> - I wanted to portray the emotion of joy what it feels and looks life. The brilliance and bright colors. 
                    Along with the warmth of that feeling. The home has always been an inspiration of mine. What it looks like feels like, 
                    what it can be. Nature will always play a big part and continue to inspire me in many works of art. God reminds me that 
                    family is grounded like roots of a tree. This piece was created out of cardboard materials, water color, and acrylic paint. 
                    Each layer was carefully placed to create this 3D model.</p>
