            <p>Joceline Began art in elementary exploring with anything she could get her hands on. Then moving to painting when she was first gifted paints. 
                She would scribble alot. She would create for her enjoyment and fun but as she got older art began meaning so much more to her. It was a way for her
                to express herself and through the moods and creations she would capture through practice and a steady hand. She persued art in highschool,
                winning awards in the school contest. She then moved to pursue it as a career, wanting to bring joy and meaning into the lives of those who saw it.
                As well as a way to worship God. She now pursues Art as a College student at BYU-Idaho, studying to receive her illustration degree.</p>
