        Joceline Began art in elementary exploring with anything she could get her hands on. Then moving to painting when she was first gifted paints. 
        She would scribble alot. She would create for her enjoyment and fun but as she got older art began meaning so much more to her. It was a way for her
        to express herself and through the moods and creations she would capture through practice and a steady hand. She persued art in highschool,
        winning awards in the school contest. She then moved to pursue it as a career, wanting to bring joy and meaning into the lives of those who saw it.
        As well as a way to worship God. She now pursues Art as a College student at BYU-Idaho, studying to receive her illustration degree.

      <h3>Digital Art</h3>
      <p>
        Deep Thoughts - We are always thinking, learning and pushing ourselves towards something innovated. I created this art on behalf of my little brother
        who seems deep in thought. It could be trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Halfway - I created a texture that felt complete but not fully rendered. It feels complete, It feels fresh. The idea of trying to trick the eyes to believe
        a different story is exciting. Not everything needs to be compelted to be fully understood.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>3D Art</h3>
      <p>
        Joceline made this piece by using everyday cardboard and paper scraps. She sculpted this piece using mainly boxes that would have otherwise
        been recycled or thrown away. It is exciting to see things 3 dimensional, and it helps Joceline to see new potential. She enjoys trying new things.
        When she sees something 3D it makes it feel real to her, and she wants to convey this meaning to others.

        Peaceful House - I wanted to portray the emotion of joy what it feels and looks life. The brilliance and bright colors. 
        Along with the warmth of that feeling. The home has always been an inspiration of mine. What it looks like feels like, 
        what it can be. Nature will always play a big part and continue to inspire me in many works of art. God reminds me that 
        family is grounded like roots of a tree. This piece was created out of cardboard materials, water color, and acrylic paint. 
        Each layer was carefully placed to create this 3D model.

      <h3>Arylic Art</h3>
      <p>
        My Potential - I wanted to show a reflection of who we each are and how we can accomplish
        great things. I have always found swans beautiful, holding great meaning. To relate and reflect on how
        we should see ourselves. In a kinder way how God sees us, and the potential we have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Happiness - I wanted to portray the emotion of joy, what it feels and looks like. The brilliance
        and bright colors. Along with the warmth of the feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clear Mind - Sometimes we can feel stuck, no matter what it is. Our emotinos and feelings are part of who we are. Nature
        reminds me of different emotions within myself. Dark clouds remind me of what is around the corner. It also reminds me of
        peace. Dark clouds are beautiful but as temporary as well. I can clear my mind by remembering this always.
