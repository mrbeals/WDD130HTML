                <h1>About Joceline</h1>
                <p>Joceline Began art in elementary exploring with anything she could get her hands on. Then moving to painting when she was first gifted paints. 
                    She would scribble alot. She would create for her enjoyment and fun but as she got older art began meaning so much more to her. It was a way for her
                    to express herself and through the moods and creations she would capture through practice and a steady hand. She persued art in highschool,
                    winning awards in the school contest. She then moved to pursue it as a career, wanting to bring joy and meaning into the lives of those who saw it.
                    As well as a way to worship God. She now pursues Art as a College student at BYU-Idaho, studying to receive her illustration degree.

                <h2>Clear Mind</h2>
                <div class="acrylicpopuptext">Clear Mind - Sometimes we can feel stuck, no matter what it is. Our emotinos and feelings are part of who we are. Nature
                    reminds me of different emotions within myself. Dark clouds remind me of what is around the corner. It also reminds me of
                    peace. Dark clouds are beautiful but as temporary as well. I can clear my mind by remembering this always.</div>
