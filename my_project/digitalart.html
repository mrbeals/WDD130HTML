                <h1>Joceline's Digital Journey</h1>
                <p>I started doing digital art in high school as well. I learned after working with water color. I got into digital art after I learned how much I could save on paper. As well how after seeing the digital art of artists 
                    I loved growing up. It sparked an interest in me to explore further. It was another fun way for me to express myself without the stress 
                    of having to buy more physical materials which was a bonus. After learning more about digital art it changed the perspective of how I 
                    approached creating art. It made me see digital art differently than how I approached creating physical art. It was a good change for me. 
                    When I create digital art I approach it in a more technical way learning about the app or software I use. 
                    This is such an important part of understanding digital art.

            <p><i>Halfway</i> - I created a texture that felt complete but not fully rendered. It feels complete, It feels fresh. The idea of trying to trick the eyes to believe
                a different story is exciting. Not everything needs to be compelted to be fully understood.</p>
