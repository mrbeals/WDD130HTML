                <h1>Joceline's Acrylic Journey</h1>
                <p>I first started painting in high school after being pushed the right direction from an art teacher. Color terrified me because I 
                    understood how complicated it was. My high school art teacher helped me have the courage to  explore the vibrant world of color. 
                    First started with watercolor then acrylic. I found a deeper love with acrylic paint because it was such a beautiful and kind medium. 
                    It was the perfect starting point for me. After working on acrylic paint I tried oil paints. Today I have such a deep love for painting and 
                    want to continue to learn more. My favorite part about painting is the fun paint messes. Doing it physically with my hands is very satisfying, 
                    seeing the colors mix.overcoming my fear for color made me 
                    learn that you can’t let fear stop you from trying new things. To not let that be a reason why you didn’t further explore those passions.

                <p><i>Happiness</i> - I wanted to portray the emotion of joy, what it feels and looks like. The brilliance
                    and bright colors. Along with the warmth of the feeling.</p>

                <p><i>Clear Mind</i> - Sometimes we can feel stuck, no matter what it is. Our emotinos and feelings are part of who we are. Nature
                    reminds me of different emotions within myself. Dark clouds remind me of what is around the corner. It also reminds me of
                    peace. Dark clouds are beautiful but as temporary as well. I can clear my mind by remembering this always.</p>

                    <p><i>My Potential</i> - I wanted to show a reflection of who we each are and how we can accomplish
                        great things. I have always found swans beautiful, holding great meaning. To relate and reflect on how
                        we should see ourselves. In a kinder way how God sees us, and the potential we have.</p>
